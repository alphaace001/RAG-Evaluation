And this Amrit kaal is the time of duty for all of us. This Amrit Kaal is the period for all of us to do something for Maa Bharati. During the war of independence, the generation that was born before 1947 got the opportunity to sacrifice their lives for the country. They did not leave any opportunity to die for the country. But we do not have the opportunity to die for the country. But there cannot be a greater opportunity than this for us to live for the country! We must live every moment for the country and with this resolution, we need to frame a new resolve for fulfilling the dreams of 140 crore countrymen in this \\u2018Amrit Kaal\\u2019. The resolution of 140 crore countrymen needs to be accomplished and when the tricolor will be hoisted in 2047, then the world will be praising a developed India. With this belief, with this determination, my best wishes to all of you. My heartiest congratulations!\\n\\nOur work culture of aspirational mindset, thinking big, farsightedness, Sarvajan Hitaya: SarvajanSukhaya: Such has been our working style. And with this energy we work on how to achieve beyond and more than a resolution. We had resolved to make 75 thousand Amrit Sarovar in the Amrit Mahotsav of independence. At that time, we had resolved to make 75 Amrit Sarovar in every district. Around 50-55 thousand Amrit Sarovars were conceived. But today the work of construction of about 75 thousand Amrit Sarovar is going on. This in itself is a humongous task. This strength of manpower and water power is also going to be useful in safeguarding India\\u2019s environmental wealth. Providing electricity to 18 thousand villages, opening bank accounts for the masses, building toilets for daughters, all the targets will be accomplished with full force ahead of time.\\n\\nWe have many dreams, clear resolutions, and definite policies. There is no questioning the intention. However, we must accept some truths and work towards their solutions. Therefore, my dear family members, I have come to the Red Fort today to seek your help and blessings, because in recent years, I have understood the nation\\u2019s needs and assessed its necessities. Based on my experience, I am saying that we must now address these matters with seriousness. During the \\u2018Amrit Kaal\\u2019 of independence, when the nation celebrates 100 years of freedom in 2047, at that time, the Tricolour should be of a developed India in the world.

Today, the nation is experiencing a sense of security and when the nation is secured, peace is established that helps us realize new dreams of progress.

The figures that you hear tell a compelling story of change, and you may wonder how this was achieved, how powerful is our capability to facilitate such a transformation. 10 years ago, 30 lakh crore rupees used to go to the states from the Government of India. In the last 9 years, this figure has reached 100 lakh crores. Earlier, 70 thousand crore rupees were spent from the treasury of the Government of India for the development of local bodies, today it is going to more than 3 lakh crores. Earlier, 90 thousand crore rupees were spent to build the houses of the poor; today it has increased 4 times and more than 4 lakh crores are being spent to build the houses of the poor.\\n\\nThe various schemes from housing schemes, providing 50,000 crore rupees to street vendors through the PM SVANidhi scheme, and many more have aided these 13.5 crore people to rise above the hardships of poverty. In the days to come, we will launch a scheme on the occasion of VishwakarmaJayanti, benefiting individuals skilled in traditional craftsmanship, particularly from the OBC community. Weavers, goldsmiths, blacksmiths, laundry workers, barbers, and such families will be empowered through the Vishwakarma Yojana, which will begin with an allocation of around 13-15 thousand crore rupees. We have directly deposited 2.5 lakh crore rupees into the accounts of our farmers through the PM KisanSammanNidhi. We have spent 2 lakh crore rupees on the Jal Jeevan Mission, ensuring pure water to every household. We have eased the burden of the poor visiting hospitals during illness under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana. We have spent 70,000 crore rupees under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana ensuring they have access to medicine, treatment, and quality hospital care. The country is aware that we spent 40,000 crore rupees to provide free vaccines during the Corona crisis.
